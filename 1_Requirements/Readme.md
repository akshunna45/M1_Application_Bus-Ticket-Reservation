## Research
- In our daily life we have to book ticket for Bus. When we do this task manually then it becomes very hard to manage the ticket booking. So we   are developing this system to manage booking of ticket automatically. 
- In this bus ticket booking project we develop the system that can help the user to book their ticket online. 
- In this project we take care of every service related to travelling and online ticket booking. When you start your traveling tour you have to book ticket so we help you from the starting point to the end point. 

### What is Ticket Reservation System?
- A Ticket Reservation System allows a potential customer to book and pay for a service directly through a website. That means from the moment a customer decides they want to book a slot for the service to choosing a date, picking a time, and paying for the booking, everything is handled online! It greatly reduces the workload on your staff and removes the opportunity for double-bookings.
