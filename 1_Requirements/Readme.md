## Introduction
-   This Software project is aimed at automation of Online Ticket Booking. Objective of the project is to develop customize software package for Ticket Reservation. 

## Research
-   In our daily life we have to book ticket for Bus. When we do this task manually then it becomes very hard to manage the ticket booking. So we   are developing this system to manage booking of ticket automatically. 
-   In this bus ticket booking project we develop the system that can help the user to book their ticket online. 
-   In this project we take care of every service related to travelling and online ticket booking. When you start your traveling tour you have to book ticket so we help you from the starting point to the end point. 

### What is Ticket Reservation System
-   A Ticket Reservation System allows a potential customer to book and pay for a service directly through a website. That means from the moment a customer decides they want to book a slot for the service to choosing a date, picking a time, and paying for the booking, everything is handled online! It greatly reduces the workload on your staff and removes the opportunity for double-bookings.

### Bus Details
#### Sleeper/Non_Sleeper Bus 
-   Sleeper Buses are those built with either 2-level or 3-level sleeping bunks, or beds, where passengers can pull a curtain or screen to get a private bed onboard the bus.
-   Non_Sleeper Buses are those built with 2-seated column and 3-seated column in each row.
#### AC/Non_AC Bus
-   AC Bus is one kind of bus type that is very comfortable for any kind of journeys. AC buses have the facilities like Push-Back & Water Bottle Holdings etc. Some of the AC buses may have Mobile Charges Facility.

#### Single_Decker/Double_Decker Bus

## Cost and Features and Timeline
### Cost
-   In the development of this project there is no major cost include because we didn't implement it on server till now and we also didn't created any eyepleasing user interface for it.
### Feature
-   Some important feature of this project is that it is very easy and stable to implement on any old system.
### Timeline

## SWOT Analysis
### Strengths
-   A Bus Ticket Reservation system automates the process. After a booking is made, the platform automatically reduces the seats available in the bus. 
### Weaknesses
-   Many online travel sites advertise low rates and offers to attract user's attention.
### Opportunities
-   User can save time by booking tickets online without stand in a queue and cancel the reserved ticket online anywhere whenever required.
### Threats
-   The main threat are the employees themselves or some outside hackers who wish to destroy, steal, or change the data that is in our system or server. (like Credit card details, Debit card details, Other payment details, Address, Mobile Number etc.)

## 4W's and 1H's
### Who

## Detail requirements
### High Level Requirements
-   This project can be implemented by using c language in both windows and linux os.   
-   This project will require all the input from user end and then it can perform required tasks on it.                        
### Low level Requirements
